Posted 5 days ago",SNV,,Việt Nam,,"Company Description
SNV is a not-for-profit international development organisation that makes a lasting difference in the lives of people living in poverty by helping them raise incomes and access basic services. We focus on three sectors and have a long-term, local presence in over 25 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our team of more than 1,300 staff is the backbone of SNV. For more information: www.snv.org
SNV has been working in Viet Nam since 1995. Using market-based approaches, SNV is committed to reducing poverty by catalysing environmentally sustainable solutions for the poor in agri-food, renewable energy, water sectors.
The three phased Project “Biogas Program for Animal Husbandry Sector of Viet Nam 2003-2020 (BP) was implemented by the Department of Livestock Production and managed by MARD, with technical assistance from SNV, and financial contribution through ODA from the Netherlands’ Government and other donors. Its overall objective was in line with the development situation of the country and Viet Nam's strategy on renewable energy development and climate change prevention and green growth. It contributed to improve the livelihood and quality of life of rural people in Viet Nam through exploiting the market and on-market benefits of the domestic biogas plants and sector by developing a market-based biogas sector. The main project intervention was to support the construction and installation of biogas plants at household level with high quality to ensure the effectiveness of biogas plant use of households.
The Third Phase (BP III 2016 - 2020) developed a strategy to phase out ODA support, phase in carbon financing, and explore incentive mechanisms (Results Based Financing) to support the development of biogas enterprises; empowering masons and bio-digester installers to become independent sellers. By end of 2020, the Biogas program contributed with 180,000 biodigesters. By developing a stronger involvement of the private sector in the biogas market, Viet Nam benefited from a more reliant and self-sustaining sector.
To pursue the sustainability of the biogas sector, the Biogas Program was registered under the Gold Standard (GS) and has become an important contributor to the global carbon market, as its total credits account for 2.6% of the global credits issued. By the end of BP III in 2020, a total of 3.07 million GS VERs (Verified Emission Reductions) were issued for the BP, accounting for 75% of the total GS carbon credits issued in Viet Nam. Over the period 2016 – 2020, the VERs revenue streams contribution to the total BP budget grew from 10% in 2017 to 63% by the end of 2020. Carbon revenue, therefore, played a critical role in leveraging ODA and enabled the BP to become more self-reliant over time. However, the deployment of the carbon revenue has been contingent to the BP receiving ODA, thus SNV looked into new green financing modalities.
Considering the great achievement of three phase Biogas program, Shell International Eastern Trading Company (SIETCO) provided funding through SNV to continue supporting Viet Nam’s livestock sector in seeking biogas solution for small holders to provide clean and affordable energy to rural households, continue promoting the biogas market to create jobs for rural labour, contributing to rural development and environmental protection. The “Biodigesters Programme for a low-carbon livestock sector in Viet Nam (BioLive)” expected to contribute to GHG emissions reduction for livestock sector to combat the climate change. The project is governed and implemented by SNV over a 12-year period from 2022-2033. The BioLive project builds on the capacities and expertise of SNV after 18 years of experiences in the implementation of the Biogas Programme. Aiming to support the installation of 50,000 new biodigesters for smallholder farmers.
To continue implementing the BioLive project, SNV is looking for two full time Biogas Advisor/Officer who will be in charge of trainings to biogas entrepreneurs (BE), biodigester installation verification, coordination with provincial departments and promotion of the biogas market with specific scopes of work and deliverables as well as tasks and responsibilities below:

We’re looking for the next generation of high-performing, multi-lingual, post-graduate talent to take our company forward. Hilti Outperformer is a global management development program like no other, with real responsibility from day one.
Who is Hilti?
Hilti is where innovation is improving productivity, safety and sustainability in the global construction industry, and beyond. Where strong customer relationships are creating solutions that build a better future. Where there is pride and a sense of belonging across our 120 locations, carrying right into our lives and homes. Where people are exploring possibilities, leveraging their potential, owning their personal development and growing lasting careers..
What does the role involve?
Hilti Outperformer is a two-year program, where you’ll quickly be involved in a range of international projects, with lots of exposure to senior management. It’s fast paced and challenging, but we’ll closely coach and mentor you. The program is split into four main stages of work:

12 months as an account manager or field engineer in the country where you apply.
3 months on an operational project in national headquarters. It could be logistics, HR, finance, marketing or engineering.
6 months on a strategic project in the regional headquarters (Singapore)
3 months on a strategic project outside the region. If you’ve come from a mature market, you’ll work in an emerging market, and vice versa.
80% of our management positions are filled with internal candidates. It’s testament to how much we value, develop and look after our people.
What do we offer?
Show us what you can do and, in return, we promise you the experience of a lifetime, the opportunity to work internationally, and a fast-track career in global senior management. You’ll also take part in some fascinating courses and events:

Leadership development program – a comprehensive learning journey with IMD business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, with a qualification from IMD.
Business management training – individual training at Hilti. A focus on behavioral profiles, personal strengths, leadership styles and communication skills.
Global summit – 4-5 days at our global headquarters in Liechtenstein. A look at the way global business units function, plus soft skills like situational leadership and international teamwork.
Social project – 7-8 days ‘building a better future’. A hands-on and hugely impactful community project, like our recent house building for displaced refugees in Bosnia.
What you need is:
You’re currently studying a master’s degree or PhD or you've recently graduated. Your Masters degree is likely to be in business management or engineering, but we’ll consider subjects like economics, politics or international studies if you can demonstrate you have a mind for our business.
You’ve spent at least three months, and up to two years, in a professional environment, like an internship, apprenticeship or work experience, or have just started your career and want an opportunity where you can perform well and progress.
You’re multilingual – fluent in English plus another language or two – and you’ve gained international experience during your work or studies.
You’re mature and assertive, curious and committed.
You’re a flexible team player with good communication and social skills.
You’re a global thinker, keen for intercultural experiences and opportunities working abroad.
Vietnamese Citizenship / Permanent Residence
Why should you apply?
We have an excellent mix of people, which we believe makes for a more vibrant, more innovative, more productive team. So, if you’ve never worked in construction, that’s fine with us. Success at Hilti is down to teamwork and ability, no matter what your background.
By submitting your resume, you confirm and agree that Hilti Far East Pte Ltd and its related companies worldwide (collectively, “Hilti Group”) may collect, use and disclose your data for their recruitment purposes.

CALL FOR CONSULTANCY SERVICE
A national consultant to conduct an analysis of cost-effectiveness
of HIV viral load testing services
I. Background:
The global LHSS project helps low- and middle-income countries transition to sustainable, self-funded health finance systems that support high-performing overall health systems. The LHSS activity in Vietnam will work with the Government of Vietnam (GVN) to advance greater local ownership of HIV and TB prevention and control. Led by Abt Associates, the four-year activity will support Vietnam in increasing its domestic financing for HIV and TB services in the context of declining donor funding, using government resources more efficiently, and assuming local ownership of HIV and TB prevention and control activities. Specific objectives are: (1) Support the GVN to strengthen its public financial management systems for public sector health and find greater efficiencies in social health insurance (SHI), (2) Increase and improve the efficiency of domestic financing of HIV prevention and treatment services; (3) Strengthen the capacity of Vietnam's supply chain management system; and (4) Transition of TB services into SHI.
Viral load tests for HIV are currently provided at health facilities where PLHIV receive ARV treatment or outsourced to certified laboratories either in the same localities or outside the provinces/cities which requires the transportation of specimens. Per the recent USAID visits to USAID’s supported provinces, it was noticed that most provinces wanted to provide HIV viral load tests at laboratories inside the provinces. In order to help optimize the provincial VL testing network, USAID requested LHSS to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of VL tests performed on the testing machines placed at provincial CDCs, provincial hospitals, and health facilities. This analysis would help inform the provincial’s decision of either maintaining the current VL test provision network or making further investments in expanding it. The analysis will target 14 laboratories having VL testing machines in five USAID-supported provinces namely Ho Chi Minh City, Dong Nai, Tay Ninh, Tien Giang, and Quang Ninh.
II. Tasks and Deliverables:
Tasks:
The consultant's role will encompass collaborative engagement with the USAID/EpiC project, provincial, CDCs, and hospitals situated within the provinces receiving support from USAID. His/her primary task will be to gather pertinent data and information, which will be subsequently employed to execute a comprehensive analysis focusing on assessing the cost-effectiveness of the HIV viral load tests performed on the testing machines placed in the provinces. This analysis will inform and guide the formulation of recommendations pertaining to further investment of testing machines to optimize the HIV viral load testing network within the provinces.
Deliverables:
A methodology paper describing how the analysis will be conducted.
A draft analysis report for comments by LHSS, USAID, and implementing partners.
Presentations with summarized results if requested by LHSS for
Final analysis report with recommendations on the expansion of the VL testing network.
Consultant monthly reports on the progress of task implementation.
A final consultancy report.
Consultant shall submit monthly reports that describe the work done in the month, key findings, and attachment of supporting documents if any. The consultant shall submit the final report at the end of the contract.
III. Location and timing:
The expert's assignment is in Hanoi with travelling to the five mentioned provinces.
The assignment should take place from December 2023 through May 2024 with a total of up to 50 working days.
IV. Requirements:
Graduate degree in health economics, health financing, public finance management, or relevant disciplines.
Proven experience in designing and conducting cost-effectiveness analyses for health services.
Good understanding of the laboratory system in the health sector and policies regulating laboratory services.
Analytical and forecasting skills: Proficient in analyzing economic and financial data, providing forecasts, and proposing suitable investment strategies.
Ability to work effectively with USAID, CDCs, provincial hospitals, and other government agencies.
Language requirement: Vietnamese. The ability to speak English would be an advantage.
V. Management of the assignment
The consultant will report to the Technical Director at LHSS Vietnam. He/She will work closely with the USAID/EpiC project, provincial, CDCs, and hospitals situated within the provinces receiving support from USAID and others as needed.

Job description
The position
We’re the team behind projects like BI tool , database diagram tool , and open-source project . We’re looking for another front-end engineer to help us build more awesome tools for data teams and developers.
This is a full-time position based in Ho Chi Minh City with flexible, hybrid WFH/WFO setup.
Our application’s architecture
To get a taste of how working with us is like, here are some insights into how our application has been built so far.
The Holistics app works by allowing data analysts to connect to their data warehouses and develop reusable “data models”. This allows non-technical users to use a friendly drag-and-drop interface to explore the data and build dashboards, without the need to bother their technical colleagues.
On the frontend side, Vue.js 3.0 with TypeScript is our framework of choice for front-end development. To deal with displaying huge amount of data, we build sophisticated, custom Vue components that lazily render the data. Since many complex computation are done on the front-end, we also use Web workers to decouple those computation from the main rendering thread. This enables smoother user experience while also decoupling computation from rendering logic.
Most of our “as-code” features operate in dual modes: code-mode and UI-mode. The code is for technical-savvy users, while the UI mode is for those who prefer a more intuitive start. To support these features, we have developed our own compiler and a web-based editor, similar to a lightweight version of VSCode, both of which are optimized for performance in the browser environment.
On the backend side, Holistics is built using Ruby on Rails as the main web framework. Unlike standard Rails project structure, we modularize the code base into local gems and to improve maintainability and extensibility, following . This also follows the pattern of “ with the gems being mostly functional/stateless code and engines handle the imperative/stateful part of the app.
By using to add static typing on top of Ruby, we ensure that most of our Ruby code has annotated type signature. This not only reduces a whole swath of common bugs that plague Ruby codebases but also significantly improves developer productivity through IDE/editor integrations.
We use PostgreSQL for our main production database due to its reliability and rich feature-set. We have built a , which are then executed using Sidekiq on top of Redis.
What you’ll work on here
Here are some interesting engineering projects that have been going on inside Holistics
Build a web-based IDE for data analysts to explore and develop analytics logic
Build front-end components that can render hundreds of thousand of data points
Build custom, interactive visualization components on top of open source technology
Create a as part of a semantic layer to represent analytics logic
Build a text-based database for analytics metadata on top of Git
Create a that compiles to SQL
Design and build a natural language interface for business users to explore data and view dashboards
The way we work
We follow Spotify squad model. Our team is split into 4 squads, each (5-7 members) consisting of engineers, product managers & designers working closely together.
How we work on a new feature:
Product & Design Team spends time research the problem, talk to customers and prepare Product Discovery Doc (PDD) and Product Requirement Doc (PRD).
Engineering Team then performs a Technical Research. When we have a fairly good picture of the complexity and impact, we’ll start with the implementation.
We do not compromise product and code quality for artificial deadline. We refactor and think about code optimization regularly. We understand the good and bad of technical debt and use them to our advantage.
We employ “pair programming” practices regularly where two team members work on a task together in one workstation. This brings a great deal of benefits, among which are faster knowledge transfer, reduced bus factor, better team cohesion and improved code quality.
We have a strong writing culture: Almost everything is communicated through written documents. Just as our developers write reusable codes, we write .
We maintain a problem-solving culture. Everyone is strongly encouraged to have rigorous understanding of a problem, separating as well as using to find the most important dimensions of a problem. Solutions are deliberated over with trade-offs explicitly listed in discussion documentation. Watch that our cofounder gave (in Vietnamese)
We avoid being a . We’re aware more features do not equal better product.
We let team members rotate every 3-6 months. This allows them to try new things and learn different aspects of the business.
Our culture stimulates continuous learning:
We have a where team members present topics they are interested in.
Engineering Team organizes as well as monthly technical workshops.
Product Team has regular AMA events with external product experts
Your skills and experience
What we look for in you
Here’s our idea of a good team member fit:
You should have a profound interest in the front-end domain. You deeply care about the user experience and building high-performance front-end components.
You should have a strong foundation in Computer Science with good problem-solving ability.
Experience with our technology stack not required: While it’s a bonus, it’s not a requirement for you to be familiar with our current technical stack. We expect you to be able to pick up these quickly on the job.
You should be someone with a continuous learning & growth mindset. You find yourself excited to learn something new as part of the work every week.
Communications: Given we have a strong writing culture, you should be comfortable with communicating your ideas in English written forms.
Genuine interest in the space: We’d love to work with people who are genuinely interested in the product and the space we’re in, someone who cares about the end-product beyond just writing the code that makes it work.
Interview Process
Round 1: Technical interview with the Engineering team (understand your skills and experiences). (Showcase your past front-end projects is highly welcome. We would love to know your approaches to solving UX challenges/performance optimization. Additionally, sharing your codes would be greatly appreciated, as it provides us with a deeper insight into your problem-solving skills and technical prowess.)‍
Round 2: Either System Design interview or takehome assignment (offline - deadline 3 days, will be sent after Round 1)
Round 3: Culture & Behavior Interview

ABOUT ELFIE

Elfie is a global healthcare digital company focused on revolutionising wellness solutions to enhance individual health outcomes. Our vision is to provide a holistic and gamified solution to monitor general health and chronic diseases, the silent killers of our generation.
Each year, 25% of all people die from a chronic disease (hypertension, diabetes, cholesterol, angina, asthma…). So much of that could be avoided if people were aware of their condition and followed their doctor's prescription and lifestyle recommendations. Unfortunately, they don’t due to a lack of awareness of danger, unwillingness to change lifestyle, and costs to follow treatment (lifelong).

Elfie is a disruptive disease prevention and management application that gamified self-monitoring and supports patients worldwide with AI-driven coaching. It is promoted by 10,000s of doctors and endorsed by multiple healthcare leaders worldwide.

In collaboration with Willis Towers Watson, a renowned global advisory, broking, and solutions company, we are embarking on an exciting venture to establish a thriving business in the field of wellness. Together with WTW, we will create a unique solution, Elfie Works, available exclusively to WTW clients and partners that will leverage the full spectrum of WTW expertise and assets combined with a premium version of Elfie that will include the best in breed of available technology and gamification.

As we pioneer this initiative, we are seeking an AI Coaching Product Manager to take our text & video coaching capabilities to the next level in terms of user engagement and health impact.
